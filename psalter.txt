{72:5} In labore hominum non sunt, et cum hominibus non flagellabuntur:
{72:5} They are not with the hardships of men, nor will they be scourged with men.
{72:6} Ideo tenuit eos superbia, operti sunt iniquitate et impietate sua.
{72:6} Therefore, arrogance has held on to them. They have been covered with their iniquity and impiety.
{72:7} Prodiit quasi ex adipe iniquitas eorum: transierunt in affectum cordis.

{72:15} If I were to say that I would explain this: Behold, I would condemn this nation of your sons.
{72:16} Existimabam ut cognoscerem hoc, labor est ante me:
{72:16} I considered, so that I might know this. It is a hardship before me,
{72:17} Donec intrem in Sanctuarium Dei: et intelligam in novissimis eorum.
{72:17} until I may enter into the Sanctuary of God, and understand it to its last part.
{72:18} Verumtamen propter dolos posuisti eis: deiecisti eos dum allevarentur.
{72:18} So, because of deceitfulness, truly, you have placed it before them. While they were being lifted up, you were casting them down.
{72:19} Quomodo facti sunt in desolationem, subito defecerunt: perierunt propter iniquitatem suam.
{72:19} How have they been brought to desolation? They have suddenly failed. They have perished because of their iniquity.
{72:20} Velut somnium surgentium Domine, in civitate tua imaginem ipsorum ad nihilum rediges.
{72:20} As a dream is to those who awaken, O Lord, so will you reduce their image to nothing in your city.
{72:21} Quia inflammatum est cor meum, et renes mei commutati sunt:
{72:21} For my heart has been inflamed, and my temperament has been changed.
{72:22} et ego ad nihilum redactus sum, et nescivi.
{72:22} And so, I have been reduced to nothing, and I did not know it.
{72:23} Ut iumentum factus sum apud te: et ego semper tecum.
{72:23} I have become like a beast of burden to you, and I am always with you.
{72:24} Tenuisti manum dexteram meam: et in voluntate tua deduxisti me, et cum gloria suscepisti me.

{72:26} Defecit caro mea et cor meum: Deus cordis mei, et pars mea Deus in æternum.
{72:26} My body has failed, and my heart: O God of my heart, and God my portion, into eternity.
{72:27} Quia ecce, qui elongant se a te, peribunt: perdidisti omnes, qui fornicantur abs te.
{72:27} For behold, those who put themselves far from you will perish. You have perished all those who fornicate away from you.
{72:28} Mihi autem adhærere Deo bonum est: ponere in Domino Deo spem meam: ut annunciem omnes prædicationes tuas, in portis filiæ Sion.
{72:28} But it is good for me to adhere to God, to put my hope in the Lord God, so that I may announce all your prophecies, at the gates of the daughter of Zion.

{73:5} et non cognoverunt sicut in exitu super summum. Quasi in silva lignorum securibus

{73:6} exciderunt ianuas eius in idipsum: in securi, et ascia deiecerunt eam.

{77:5} And he has received testimony with Jacob, and he has set a law within Israel. Such great things, he has commanded our fathers, so as to make these things known to their sons,

{77:20} Quoniam percussit petram, et fluxerunt aquæ, et torrentes inundaverunt. Numquid et panem poterit dare, aut parare mensam populo suo?
{77:20} He struck the rock, and so waters flowed and the torrents flooded, but would even he be able to provide bread, or provide a table, for his people?”

{77:21} Therefore, the Lord heard, and he was dismayed, and a fire was kindled within Jacob, and an anger ascended into Israel.
{77:22} Quia non crediderunt in Deo, nec speraverunt in salutari eius:

{77:28} Et ceciderunt in medio castrorum eorum: circa tabernacula eorum.
{77:28} And they fell down in the midst of their camp, encircling their tabernacles.
{77:29} Et manducaverunt et saturati sunt nimis, et desiderium eorum attulit eis:

{77:30} non sunt fraudati a desiderio suo. Adhuc escæ eorum erant in ore ipsorum,
{77:30} They were not cheated out of what they wanted. Their food was still in their mouth,
{77:31} et ira Dei ascendit super eos. Et occidit pingues eorum, et electos Israel impedivit.
{77:31} and then the wrath of God came upon them. And he slew the fat ones among them, and he impeded the elect of Israel.
{77:32} In omnibus his peccaverunt adhuc: et non crediderunt in mirabilibus eius.
{77:32} In all these things, they continued to sin, and they were not trustworthy with his miracles.
{77:33} Et defecerunt in vanitate dies eorum: et anni eorum cum festinatione.
{77:33} And their days faded away into vanity, and their years with haste.
{77:34} Cum occideret eos, quærebant eum: et revertebantur, et diluculo veniebant ad eum.
{77:34} When he slew them, then they sought him. And they returned, and they drew near to him in the early morning.
{77:35} Et rememorati sunt quia Deus adiutor est eorum: et Deus excelsus redemptor eorum est.
{77:35} And they were mindful that God is their helper and that the Most High God is their redeemer.
{77:36} Et dilexerunt eum in ore suo, et lingua sua mentiti sunt ei:
{77:36} And they chose him with their mouth, and then they lied to him with their tongue.
{77:37} Cor autem eorum non erat rectum cum eo: nec fideles habiti sunt in testamento eius.
{77:37} For their heart was not upright with him, nor have they been living faithfully in his covenant.
{77:38} Ipse autem est misericors, et propitius fiet peccatis eorum: et non disperdet eos. Et abundavit ut averteret iram suam: et non accendit omnem iram suam:
{77:38} Yet he is merciful, and he will pardon their sins. And he will not destroy them. And he has abundantly turned aside his own wrath. And he did not enflame his wrath entirely.
{77:39} Et recordatus est quia caro sunt: spiritus vadens, et non rediens.
{77:39} And he remembered that they are flesh: with a spirit that goes forth and does not return.
